# Information-Bottleneck-Method
The Information Bottleneck (IB) method, introduced by Tishby et al., provides a principled framework for extracting relevant information from a signal while compressing input data. Instead of specifying an arbitrary distortion measure, IB compresses the input variable X while preserving as much information as possible about a target variable Y.
